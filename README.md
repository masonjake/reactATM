# reactATM

This is a webpage built with react. It simulates a simple ATM that allows the users to deposit and withdraw money based on an input box. I improved this project by adding a Radial button selector instead of a dropdown menu. I felt that this was a more effective way for the user to decide which action they would like to do.
